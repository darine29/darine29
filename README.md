Hello, welcome to my GitHub page! My name is Darine and I am a second-year Bachelor of Science student at the University of British Columbia, aiming to secure a degree in Computer Science. 

My journey into technology has been fueled by a fascination with how code can transform ideas into impactful digital experiences. Creating personal projects in both front-end and back-end web development has not only honed my technical skills, but also sparked a deep eagerness to leverage my knowledge and join this field professionally. My projects are right here on GitHub!

I am actively seeking opportunities to grow and contribute within the dynamic field of software development. With a strong foundation in both theoretical and practical aspects of computer science, I am ready to tackle new challenges and make a meaningful impact in this industry.
